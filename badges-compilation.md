## Reflections

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: JS have types now? cool, now it's almost usable.
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: Now i can explicitly define type for every variables, hope that makes me a real developer.
3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**: All that fuss was just for this. Interface > Type!
4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**: My typed function are better than yours!
5. **Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**: TS support classes, okay, who cares about clases nowadays anyway.
6. **Generics in TypeScript**: Works as intended! (even tho it's fake)
7. **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**: Atleast i can use someone else's code, hope i don't have to sign contract for that.
8. **Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**: Why this exist?
